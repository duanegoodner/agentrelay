"""Per-step protocols for workstream execution.

This module defines fine-grained protocol interfaces for each step of the
workstream lifecycle. :class:`~agentrelay.workstream.core.runner.WorkstreamRunner`

Protocols:
    WorkstreamPreparer: Provision worktree and integration branch.
    WorkstreamIntegrator: Create integration PR.
    WorkstreamTeardown: Clean up worktree and integration branch.
    IntegrationMergeChecker: Poll for human-initiated merge of integration PR.
