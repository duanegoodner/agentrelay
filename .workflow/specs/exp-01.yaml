# .workflow/specs/exp-01.yaml
# Experiment 1: Hand-authored spec, manual execution
#
# Purpose: Validate that the workflow vocabulary and YAML spec format are
# expressive enough to describe a real (if trivial) multi-step workflow.
# Execution is fully manual — no Python interpreter, no automated gate logic.
#
# See docs/experiment_plans/EXPERIMENT_01.md for the full execution guide.

  description: >
    Trivial 2-step workflow. Execute each step by launching Claude manually.
    Evaluate the gate yourself. Record vocabulary gaps in experiments/01-manual/NOTES.md.

        Write pytest tests for a Python function `add(a, b)` that returns `a + b`.
        Save the tests to `experiments/01-manual/tests/test_add.py`.
        Cover at minimum: two positive integers, two negative integers, mixed signs,
        two floats, and one integer + one float.
        Do NOT implement `add()` — write tests only.

        Also create a minimal stub at `experiments/01-manual/src/add.py` containing
        only the function signature with no logic (e.g. `def add(a, b): pass`).
        This stub exists so the tests can import `add` without the implementation.

        Ensure the tests can actually import `add` from the stub. Create a
        `experiments/01-manual/tests/conftest.py` (or equivalent) if the project
        structure requires it. Verify by running:
          pixi run pytest experiments/01-manual/tests/ --collect-only
        This must exit with 0 before you finish.
